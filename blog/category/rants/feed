			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Health Insurance.  In theory it&#8217;s a pretty efficient way to finance an industry&#8230; <em>in theory</em>. Yet, its crippling weakpoint is partly a result of the many types of insurance available to consumers these days.  For instance, there&#8217;s Managed Care, Fee-for-Service (the typical type with keywords: premiums, out-of-pocket expenses, co-insurance, caps), Health Maintenance Organization, Point-of-Service, Preferred Provider Organizations, blah blah blah&#8230;  From there, your head is thrust into a spinning frenzy with the likes of Health Savings Account (HSA) and other derivatives.  Oh, and there&#8217;s Medicaid, Medicare, VA stuff, each with there own sub-insurances.  Crossing the border introduces the likes of social healthcare&#8230; etc etc etc.  Are you keeping up?</p>
<p>Probably, it&#8217;s not really that hard of a concept, nor that difficult to set up.  The majority of employed Americans are on a set-it-and-forget-it configuration where they read the fine print with their HR rep during the hiring phase, choose a plan, and then not worry about it.  During my interview &amp; hiring phases I had to do the same. Being both new to the job market and personal finance, everything was all new to me.  I had no clue  what the types, benefits (both medically or tax-wise) or logistics of each were&#8230; It was all just a blur.  As is how they and the hospital&#8217;s billing department interact.  But, what I think is happening is that a huge informational gap is feeding the industry (which in turn hikes profits for both institutions, provides theoretically unnecessary jobs, ultimately complicating the system more than need be [a topic to be addressed later]) but ultimately doing a good job to jack up prices.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s bogus.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food for thought: The Grand Debate/Debacle : Nationalized vs. Market Driven Health Care.</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard this before and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all taken a part of the debate:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most industrialized nations have nationalized health care (or some variant).  Why then should the US not?</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the retort:</p>
<blockquote><p>Leave the market to work.  Its forces will generate the right self-sufficient system with the proper incentives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some opinions on the topic: <a href="http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/07/a_long_long_post_about_my_reasons_for_opposing_national_health_care.php" target="_blank">Megan McAcrdle</a>,<a href="http://www.pnhp.org/" target="_blank">Physicans for a National Healthcare Program</a> , <a href="http://www.healthcare-now.org/" target="_self">Healthcare-NOW</a>; a blog discussing it more than you could care for:<a href="http://insureblog.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"> Insureblog</a>: and some news: <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/health-care-reform/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91972152" target="_blank">NPR&#8217;s series on health care across the world</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Diving In: The Underlying Economics of the Game.</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I see the system.  It&#8217;s two parts: one part game, one part service.</p>
<p><strong>The gam</strong><strong>e  (Private Sector), </strong>like all the casinos in Las Vegas, health insurance is setup to be extremely detail oriented with a focus on profit for the industry while risk management for the player.  But we all know how insurance works in the consumer market.  You choose a plan, agree with the terms, and pay the fees, however exorbitant.</p>
<p>-The problems I see with the private sector are hidden within the numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exactly how much profit are these companies racking in from premiums?</li>
<li>What percentage of the bills are they really assuming?</li>
<li>What percentage of said bills are a direct cause of private insurance&#8217;s bureaucracy?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The service</strong> <strong>(Public Sector)</strong>, like your typical overworked and understaffed restaurant, the Government&#8217;s implementation of health-care provisions leaves much to be demanded.  Sure the amount of work put out by the few is to be commended, but it could be better.  Like most government programs, a restructuring is overdue, but not a complete overhaul.</p>
<ul>
<li>All of my experiences I&#8217;ve had with Medicaid have been timely and for that I commend them.</li>
<li>The inefficiencies and convolutions can&#8217;t be justified.  (Definition of disability, the provision of health-care to illegals over citizens)</li>
<li>The gap of the population the government doesn&#8217;t protect needs to be ameliorated.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I started writing this, I hadn&#8217;t a clue how I wanted to tackle the issues.  Even in the midst, I realized there&#8217;s really no way a single opinion can change the industry, but what can happen is information can be given to the small group of people caught in the midst of the financial nightmare the health industry can cause.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first thing you should do is call your insurance agent and shop around asking for catastrophic insurance and the differences between that and whatever you&#8217;re currently on.   This would have saved me quite a bit.  (Essentially, it only covers ER visits and anything stemming from that, protecting against the unforesen).</li>
<li>If you have any bills from any Dr&#8217;s offices or hospitals, don&#8217;t use services that promise to reduce your bill&#8230; you can do it for free.</li>
<li>Reduce your bills.  Go to both the hospital and Dr&#8217;s offices and plea your case.  Tell them you want to pay the bills but can&#8217;t.  Just walk in and ask.  I had a 1500 bill reduced to 450 and my hospital bill reduced by half and allowed to finance the remaining balance [Little known fact, but the insurance agencies will only pay a fraction of the bill's sticker price, which I think is messed up knowing that the medical industry is charging the people that can't pay that much the full price].</li>
<li>When you need medical care, try other avenues when you can (free clinics).</li>
</ol>
<p>So, this is more of a rant than anything really constructive (and not really a very well structured rant at that).  But the angst has built up since my bout with the hospital.  The real reason being that the steps involved in resolving emergency crises both financially and medically are baffling and backwards.  No wonder Washington isn&#8217;t able to agree on any health-care reform.  To me, trying to reform this type of system is like trying to resurrect a fickle and dying horse with only a loaded shotgun in hand; poke all you want but that puppy isn&#8217;t coming back (you should try it some time if you don&#8217;t believe me).  It seems that the medical industry is rampant with inefficiencies driven by the private insurance sector, and that the private insurance sector is raking in inordinate amounts of money, that there are real injustices with public health-care, all screwing the uninsured population.<br />
<strong>Thought for food&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>In, what I think, is the most astute and succinct argument against national health care:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a nutshell, I hate the poor and want them to die so that all my rich friends can use their bodies as mulch for their diamond ranches.  ~ Megan McArdle</p></blockquote>
<p>But in all seriousness, this industry is simply dizzying&#8230; something should be done to make it just work for everyone.  Please.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The federal legalese used to define "disabled" is such to leave one wondering if there truly exists such a person on earth (clearly I wouldn't qualify). [...It also] seems to be the state's goal and intent to punish the actual working and educated class in its constituency...]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the situation:<br />
  I&#8217;m a recent grad (May &#8216;09) in limbo for entering PhD or MD/PhD program (Aug &#8216;10).  Can&#8217;t find a job as a software engineer in the mean-time (held one as a waiter with no benefits).  Went to the ER for what I thought was appendicitis and now, I&#8217;m in $4500 debt because I couldn&#8217;t afford the $500/mo COBRA extension on my parent&#8217;s insurance.  </p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to apply for emergency medicaid to cover my bills.  After about an hour of begging, learning, and discussing with a social worker there was a part on my paperwork that stated that <em>&#8220;You have the right to apply for Medicaid, but you chose not to because:&#8221;</em> and this is what I put:</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal legalese used to define &#8220;disabled&#8221; is such to leave one wondering if there truly exists such a person on earth (clearly I wouldn&#8217;t qualify).  Secondly because it seems to be the state&#8217;s goal and intent to punish the actual working and educated class in its constituency.  Very disappointed with the politicians.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before we discuss what the government should do, let&#8217;s create a rough flow chart for what happens when you enter any sort of medical care or facility.</p>
<p>1) Paper work&#8230; that&#8217;s usually a pretty memorable and recurring occasion.</p>
<p>2) The entourage&#8230; that&#8217;s what I call the army of nurses, MAs, RNs,(really anybody with a 2-3 letter abbreviation that&#8217;s not Dr.) all doing the monotonous work&#8230; which is fine b/c the Dr&#8217;s time is better spent doing the hard stuff.</p>
<p>3) See Dr. and get advice/diagnosis/etc</p>
<p>4) Pay.  This part can be pretty painless or more painful than the cause for the initial visit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a subtle point.  But, by enumerating the usual activities of a visit one realizes that the basic goal of a visit has been elaborated into a much more <del datetime="2010-01-16T18:38:48+00:00">artistic</del> lucrative performance.  Partly necessitated by the government and part by the industry (can you guess which is which?).  It&#8217;s pretty outstanding that out of the four events, one is much more complicated than necessary while one has been exaggerated to an excessive means (paper and paying being the two perpetrating events). What is more interesting than this transformation and magnification is the fact that both private industry and big government are responsible for the maladies in events 1 and 4.  Let&#8217;s discuss how to fix this&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>So, how and why should the government impose change to help the fraction of 47 million Americans without coverage since the system seems to be working just fine?</strong></p>
<p>Stick with me.  I know we were just discussing the paperwork and a vague financial problem but here&#8217;s the deal.  Any change at this point would be a good change for everyone involved; the American people, health care providers, but most importantly, the government.  I&#8217;m not talking about the &#8220;major government overhaul&#8221; being discussed in DC, the market doesn&#8217;t need to be corrected that much. In fact, I feel like that language is superfluous legalese coined by insurance lobbyists that in all honesty would cost us more in the long run (debatable, but not relevant to my point).  Instead what the government should be focusing on are the shortcomings and the inefficiencies it produces, not on regulating an industry.  Here&#8217;s the nitty-gritty in a few sentences:</p>
<p><strong> Implementations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The federal government pretty much only trickles down money with regulations attached forcing states to comply with federal rules while providing some sort of health care.  That&#8217;s fine&#8230;<strong><em>BUT, potential for positive change</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>For example, the official definition for &#8220;disabled&#8221; is a federally coined definition that is imposed by the land&#8217;s courts.  Your usual arbitrary legalise.</li>
<p><br/>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next, the dispersion of health care funding states receive (at least in North Carolina) seem to have some, quite frankly, ****ed up convolutions&#8230; <strong>PROBLEM HERE</strong>
<ul>
<li> &#8230;illegal immigrants get emergency medicaid in NC but an uninsured male between 20-59 is out of luck.</li>
<p><br/>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continuing&#8230; there are some rather severe resource squandering programs in effect with no incentives to change&#8230;<strong>PROBLEM HERE</strong>
<ul>
<li> &#8230;medicaid in NC provides every recipient with the right to transportation to any and every &#8220;health&#8221; related appointment, which is fine in theory.  In practice, it means that a taxi will be sent to the recipient, take them to their appointment, and wait.  There&#8217;s no incentive for social workers to schedule multiple pickups or pool recipients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s take a step back.  In this short discussion,we&#8217;ve seen the inefficiencies in a doctor&#8217;s visit while shown some areas for possible improvement without qualifying them with numbers.  In June of 2009 the Federation for American Immigration Reform, says illegal immigrants cost the state of NC $209 million-plus in health care costs (FAIR says North Carolinians who have medical insurance also pay higher medical insurance bills to help cover the costs of those without insurance).  <a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:239wy1opwSAJ:www.pnhp.org/+healthcare+dollar&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">Physicians for a National Health Program</a> claims 31 cents on the dollar that is spent on health care accounts for paper work and insurance bureaucracies alone (the PNHP goes on to claim that a streamlined non-profit government run agency would save enough to pay for universal health care, but I doubt that&#8217;s  all that needs to happen, pretty skeptical in fact).  Those are pretty crazy figures, yet are still the tip of the iceberg to topics such as illegal immigrant reform and insurance regulation. [<a href="http://obsthisland.blogspot.com/2009/06/cost-of-illegal-immigration-to-north.html" target="_blank">Read more from this guy who is obviously more passionate about it than me... author of This Land.</a>]</p>
<p>In sum, what I&#8217;d like to see is for the government to get it&#8217;s head on straight and face the simpler problems at hand by dealing with the inefficiencies and injustices in the system.  All I ask:</p>
<p>1) State governments should assure coverage to all of the legal citizens before extending care to illegals.<br />
     I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right for me to go to the Department of Social Services and have my health care coverage for an emergency denied solely because I don&#8217;t have a child, I&#8217;m not disabled, and not an illegal immigrant.  Hopefully my thoughts on this can bring down the giant curtain naturally put up by the bureaucracy that is our government because it just doesn&#8217;t seem right.  The current implementation seems to reward poor life choices and provides incentives for laziness.</p>
<p>2) A person&#8217;s degree of &#8220;disability&#8221; should be deemed by physicians, not lawyers, judges, and politicians.<br />
   The Adult Medicaid Manual MA-2525 defines <em>disability</em>: the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments that is expected to result in death or which has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  ????</p>
<p>3) The government assumes some responsibility and deals with the severe inefficiencies in it&#8217;s implementation of projects.<br />
    I know the medicare/medicaid transport well because I volunteered and wrote code for our local branch.  The DSS has 3 full-time members answering phones for this cause alone.  I feel like funds freed up from these and other inefficiencies could be used to pay for my emergency care.</p>
<p>4) Provide those uninsured with *at least* emergency care.<br />
    I don&#8217;t even see a dentist and I&#8217;ve had the same pair of glasses for 3 years.  I&#8217;m not asking for much, just basic life support.  Oh, and when you do get your act together, help those out who were screwed in the past.  That&#8217;s the least you can do. </p>
<p>Oh, and if that wasn&#8217;t enough, wrap your head around this, no words necessary:</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The first in a series exploring the sores of healthcare:  As the son of two physicians, I thought I had seen medicine from every single vantage point..]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>During those trying times in college, two things really seem to get one by, those being joy (college romances, sporting events, sports themselves, self betterment and aggrandizement, academic success, <a href="http://www.fmylife.com" target="_blank">FML</a> and <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com" target="_blank">humor</a>) and an intermittent period of self apathy leading back to joy.</p>
<p>But as one hits the real world, life turns a little sour. Some are protected by the governing bureaucracy while others are attacked by it.  So, as a fairly ambitious grad, I&#8217;ll explore some of the issues and how I see those changing the way we live and those that should themselves be changed.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the son of two physicians, I thought I had seen medicine from every single vantage point.   I remember reading the NEJM and JAMA solely because my parents thought that cartoons and other periodicals not sent down from Wall Street or the NYTimes polluted the mind.  I was that kid at school who loved squishing worms to study the insides and then pretend that my piling the lump of guts on the asphalt was my glorified way of performing surgery.</p>
<p>But very recently I (unfortunately) was given a dose of a very unnerving side of the industry.</p>
<p>Being a strappingly healthy 22 year old hot off the books, I figured I wouldn&#8217;t need routine check ups, medicine, or any other health service for a long while, so I really wasn&#8217;t too concerned about health insurance upon graduation. I, for one, was busy trying to find employment which would hopefully provide some coverage and secondly I simply couldn&#8217;t afford the added expense an insurance premium would present on my whopping $0 income/budget/net-worth. Therein lies the dilemma.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly does someone who is unemployed, uninsured, and unprotected by the government do in this case?</strong><br />
<em>   (update:) If you can afford it, there&#8217;s something called catastrophic insurance, where you don&#8217;t get health coverage per-se, but you&#8217;re insured against ER visits and anything it leads to after, during that transitional period between jobs, schools, whatever.  As it doesn&#8217;t cover most of the costs associated with health-care (check-ups, prescriptions, etc) it has a low premium and it&#8217;s also month-to-month so you can terminate once you&#8217;re back on your feet.</em></p>
<p>With the current system as is, there is a population that fall (unrightfully so) through the gaps of the social safety net.  I hadn&#8217;t realize this as I had some friends in high school who were getting copious amounts of support from our government in the form of food stamps, loans, Medicaid, child-care support etc.  Nor did I realize how convoluted the loopholes in our social safety net were until I realized how much health care was being given to illegal immigrants to my exclusion.  I was also under the naive idea that if something were to happen to me that as a non-profit hospital, our local ER was obliged to offer me care even though I was uninsured.  Overall, I generally felt guarded by the social safety net and the governing bureaucracies  over hospitals&#8230; oh, how I was wrong.</p>
<p>I was struck with a bout of pseudo-appendicitis. Being uninsured, I tried to tough out 3 days of severe lower right quadrant pain. I had a feeling it was solely food poisoning, but as symptoms began to worsen, I didn&#8217;t want to risk my life.  It&#8217;s a crippling feeling to be in that much pain, yet being completely overtaken by the knowledge of the financial demise waiting to greet me and my treatment at the ER.</p>
<p>Once in the triage, I remember two things. The first being unnerving and unending pain, and the second, some grouchy old lady who wouldn&#8217;t stop pestering me for my signature on everything (this is where knowledge about the system might have changed my outcome, as I had no clue what I was signing and was never explained the repurcusions of failing to sign, rather, I was in such a state of desperation, I could&#8217;ve offered them my future first born to get the pain to subside).</p>
<p>Long story short, an ER consult, full body contrast CT, a follow-up consult, colonoscopy, stool sample, and a colon biopsy, it was determined that I had a bacterial infection and not appendicitis.  Oh, and $3090 ER bill (the consult was free since the surgeon was a family friend, thanks Dr. G!) and the colonoscopy was reduced to ~$1500.</p>
<p>The problem: everything, but at least I&#8217;m feeling better.  Having recovered I&#8217;ve chosen to take the time and really explore the system&#8217;s crippling nature.  Back when the election debates were in full swing, I remember the Boston Globe claiming that some 47 million Americans were without health insurance.  That&#8217;s not the figure I&#8217;m debating since not having health insurance doesn&#8217;t mean that you don&#8217;t qualify for Medicaid and even some percentage of that 47 million aren&#8217;t even documented aliens.  Rather, it&#8217;s the roughly <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204731804574388730954342564.html" target="_blank">5 million</a> americans [WSJ] that don&#8217;t make over $50,000/yr and don&#8217;t qualify for government programs where these issues must be corrected.  I&#8217;m not arguing that the nation caters a program to pick up the sediment fallen between the cracks, but rather, it&#8217;s that the government steps in and changes policies (both it&#8217;s very own and those of the health industry) to morph what is more or less a broken monopoly that&#8217;s sucking the resources of a nation dry into one benefiting the nation.</p>
<p>I remember visiting websites for people struck with overwhelming health care costs asking for donations in the past.  Most of the time, these are hard working individuals who were simply dealt a poor hand and left to the mercy of the public&#8217;s sympathy.  At the same time, raised in environment engulfed within the medical industry, I find it hard to believe that our leaders can watch the abuse.  I&#8217;m documenting the exploration of my (scant) options on how to get my costs covered, but with a different approach.  I am not asking for a resolution to this debt, but rather a change that affords proper and fair health care for all.  The outlook doesn&#8217;t seem so bright, since so far in, the problems our social services attempt to ameliorate seem to reward poor life choices and protect those theoretically without rights while punishing those that pay the taxes that fund the programs&#8230; interesting.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one really anticipates the times in our lives that bring about unneeded stress. I found out the hard way when I recently got a speeding ticket this week.  The immediate financial stress and situational stress were such that I had no clue how to react to the officer&#8217;s questions while shuffling around trying to find my registration card.  The situation turned from bad to worse ssince I wasn&#8217;t prepared.</p>
<p>After the event, I was turning to lifehacker&#8217;s guide on how to fight a speeding ticket when I realized that my stress at the time as well as the following sour emotions could have been avoided with a little fore-thought.</p>
<p>At that moment, I decided to take all the relevant paper work (insurance card and registration) and combine them with two notecards, one for wrecks and one for speeding tickets.  The notecards are what really reduce stress as the how-to&#8217;s are written down so I don&#8217;t have to think.  For example:</p>
<p>How-to deal with a ticket:<br />
-hands at two and ten on the wheel at all times.<br />
-turn off all outside lights and turn on all interior ones<br />
-explain (politely) why you were speeding while feeding the officers ego by constantly apologizing.<br />
-when it&#8217;s your turn to talk, ask when the radar machine was last calibrated<br />
-ask to actually see the reading (it&#8217;s your right)<br />
- notes (where&#8217;s the last speeding sign, traffic around you, etc)</p>
<p>Again, the goal is to provide a pre-thought-out sense of sanity.  Some other things I can think of to do is simply making a spare key and duct taping it to an inconspicuous place on the car. What tips do you have?</p>
