			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>In April 2009 <a href="http://wired.com">WIRED</a> covered  a piece on digital art and it blew my mind.  The idea was to have graphic designers perform live in front of a live audience to one showcase their talents and two give the audience an idea of what goes into their work.  Given the opportunity I would definitely attend the next time around.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.cutandpaste.com/" target="_blank">Cut&amp;Paste</a> [Check them out]</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><object id="flashObj" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="404" height="436" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="flashVars" value="videoId=18978059001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fvideo%2Fcutpaste-competition-draws-designers%2F18978059001&amp;playerID=1813626064&amp;domain=embed&amp;" /><param name="base" value="http://admin.brightcove.com" /><param name="seamlesstabbing" value="false" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="swLiveConnect" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9/1813626064?isVid=1&amp;publisherID=1564549380" /><param name="name" value="flashObj" /><param name="flashvars" value="videoId=18978059001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fvideo%2Fcutpaste-competition-draws-designers%2F18978059001&amp;playerID=1813626064&amp;domain=embed&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed id="flashObj" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="404" height="436" src="http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9/1813626064?isVid=1&amp;publisherID=1564549380" name="flashObj" allowscriptaccess="always" swliveconnect="true" allowfullscreen="true" seamlesstabbing="false" base="http://admin.brightcove.com" flashvars="videoId=18978059001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fvideo%2Fcutpaste-competition-draws-designers%2F18978059001&amp;playerID=1813626064&amp;domain=embed&amp;" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"></embed></object></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Then, like the dude in the Win7 commercial, I was in the shower listening to some techno and thinking about that video&#8230;  it hit me like a ton of bricks.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Ultimate Concert [read Rave].<br />
</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">So, let&#8217;s imagine a scenario where the likes of Dr. Dre, Daft Punk, Deadmaus, Timbaland, Will.I.Am, etc, got together and put together a monster concert/contest where DJs, Mixmasters, lyricists, and light techies battled it out, putting together what perhaps could become the greatest moment in music history.  A bunch of artists mixing and producing music they&#8217;re genuinely passionate about in real time, could be an epic moment.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Sponsors.</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br />
</strong>Let&#8217;s start with the money behind the scenes (because a party can only be as sweet as the money that powers and flows into it).</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/bacardi.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-494" style="padding: 5 px;" title="bacardi" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/bacardi.jpg" alt="bacardi, techno style" width="148" height="150" /></a><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sdlkfwdlkfncwsldnvclksdnc.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-379" title="Beats by Dre" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sdlkfwdlkfncwsldnvclksdnc-150x150.jpg" alt="Beats by Dre" width="150" height="150" /></a> <strong>Bacardi:</strong> If the company is really as interested in contributing to the party seen as their commercials seem to suggest, what better event to sponsor than a massive music festival/dance/rave. Imagine the actors and the scenes in the commercials coming to life with some unique and crazy theme in each of the tour locations.   It would literally be the biggest and baddest party in town.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><strong>Beats by Dre:</strong> The brother behind the scenes (aka&#8217;d the Doctor) is all about music and feeling every aspect of it. He has a niche market within the audiophile market but has transcended the music scenes with both his product line and his career as a producer. The synergy of his two passions could be phenomenal.  Being involved in the creation and presentation of the music might take his game to a new level.   Also, by sponsoring this type of event he would have the opportunity to carve out a new product line for concert halls, one that might end up blowing our minds (and clothes off).</p>
<p><strong>Red Bull (optional)</strong>: Energy is the theme. Wings are the claim. Game on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Semantics</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The idea of this establishment is to have a massive dance party to some freaking good music making contest.  Imagine a huge arena with four stations, the crowd in the middle and four teams of dj&#8217;s and light techies putting on a show.  Each team has access to all the same cutting edge technology and music (the contest being what they&#8217;re able to produce).  Each team has a set time limit with a 4 second overlapping transition between teams.  Everything they do is put on a projector above them so that the crowd can see the &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221;.  Depending on the popularity, all kinds of other music can be produced with different genres as an extension to this pseudo-underground scene.  [incorporating the likes of Daft Punk wouldn't hurt either].</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><br />

		<description><![CDATA[and how to make your computers work for you by connecting to a home server...]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning&#8230; Being a programmer, computers have become an integral part of my life.  Up until the new year I had been trying to use a desktop and laptop with &#8220;identical&#8221; setups to complete my work.  Notice the &#8220;identical&#8221;;  that is what I wanted to fix for the new year. Both of my computers were dual booting mac and linux and each had a shared data partition accessible to each OS.  Well, the problem was that I got tired of juggling files, settings, programs and sync utilities trying to get the data and applications to match up on both (read &#8220;identical&#8221;).<br />
The requirements for the project formed pretty naturally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a unified store of data</li>
<li>Have said store accessible to any computer on my home network (ultimately any computer with internet)</li>
<li>Have the computers handle any of 3 major OS&#8217;s for software development reasons</li>
<li>Big time bonus:  If there were a way to virtualize each native install of an OS in the other two, you would reach OS zen.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, having a load of free time I decided to restructure and clean up my computing environment.  Ultimately what this meant was to install Windows after a 6 year hiatus, and move my two (theoretically) identical data partitions that were on each computer I was using to one single data folder hosted by a server.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I did.<br />
1) Set up a triple boot system with a shared data partition (I know the post is trying to convince you to lose that partition, but I set one up just in case for offline storage).  This isn&#8217;t a how-to of how to do that, but GPartedLive is by far the best tool to use.</p>
<p>2) Set up the server that acts as a NFS file server (what I think is the most accessible solution to all OSs, though requires some linux know-how) and a web server.  I chose to do this rather than buy a NAS server or some other solution becaarounduse it&#8217;s 1) more cost efficient to just use an old computer lying around and 2) it&#8217;s nice to minimize clutter by not having single purpose products lying around everywhere.</p>
<p>3)Finally, I configured the installs, unified the OS&#8217;s to have similar backgrounds, desktops, workflow, etc&#8230; but most importantly, set up access to the servers.  Here&#8217;s how to access NFS shares on different OSs after you add your computers to/etc/exports and make sure the shared directories are CHMODed 777:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Windows 7</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This one&#8217;s easy.  You&#8217;ll see a &#8220;Map network drive&#8221; icon right under the address bar when you press the My Computer icon.  Click it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Map.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-76" title="Map" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Map-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pick what letter you want the drive to be mapped to, and then put the address in, and have it reconnect at login.  Done.<br />
<a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/win7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-66" title="win7" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/win7-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Mac OSX </strong></em></p>
<p>Mounting an NFS share on mac is fairly simple.  There are two ways to do this.  1st the computer will show up under shared on the left.  You can login as a user on that server, and that&#8217;s that or you can auto-mount it by using the advanced features in the Directory Utilities under Settings : <a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/mac.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-70" title="mac" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/mac-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>openSUSE (really any linux distro)<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Add the following to the /etc/fstab:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">serverNameOrAddress:/shared/folder    /mount/to/folder    nfs    rw,user,noauto,hard,intr 0 0<a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/linux.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-63" title="linux" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/linux-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There you have it&#8230; a unified data store environment across a bunch of computers&#8230; The beauty of this setup is that it is the most natural and accessible solution to unifying data stores.  By having all the data in one spot accessible to any computer, version control becomes insignificant for the single user (not considering simultaneous access by multiple users).  Backup becomes simplified and an overall sense of relief is afforded from solving that problem.  Second, it&#8217;s a beautiful way to unclutter your computers, providing a minimalist approach to data storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So the two things that are missing are virtual machine access to native OS installs.  Secondly, a way to propagate changes of an OS across each computer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to venture off on a limb by publishing my personal goals for 2010 and how those might produce new ideas and ways of living. The approach of this series hasn&#8217;t been solidified quite yet, but being a time of restructuring here are the goals for this series:</p>
<p>1) A weekly post discussing some aspect of my life that can be bettered; a how-to of how I plan to better it; and then discuss the significance of the result.</p>
<p>2)  Since this is fairly project driven, I will try and keep the topics as broad as possible to really evaluate the state of my life. </p>
<p>3)  The posts will explicitly define the goals and the tennat of thought the goal prescribes to (common ones being frugality, minimalism, arts, etc&#8230;)</p>
<p>4)  A seemingly random work of art will be attached to keep things hot and spicy (just for fun).</p>
<p>The 52 week series will be published every Friday to afford some sort of weekend warrior culture.  Again, with the focus being on quality of life, I hope that this year becomes a rewarding one of personal exploration and awareness.  (I feel like I&#8217;m being too vague on the goals, but I really want this series to take a life of it&#8217;s own). I hope you enjoy!  </p>

		<description><![CDATA[These should be everywhere...]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last thing running through most of our minds during a snow storm are local aesthetics.  Sure having the world turn white is exciting for the first few glances, hours, or evenings, but after that the reality doesn&#8217;t seem so bright.  As obligations begin to pile the next thing we find ourselves thinking about becomes transportation (read: road conditions).  As city workers slave to clear the roads and municipal parking lots, often generating massive piles of snow, a huge artistic potential is lost with inactivity.  The sides of the road become unsightly as dirt and oil stain the bright white mounds outlining the pavement.</p>
<p>But, imagine then that cities or building complexes allowed artists to showcase their talent by putting these mounds of snow to use.  I know anyone interested in beautifying my driveway is more than welcome.  I just think it&#8217;d make winter that much more awesome/festive/beautiful.</p>
