			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your phone is probably one of, if not the, most used devices you own.  As such, most people rightfully demand the absolute best in terms of features from this type of hardware, and it is my goal in this post to show you how to secure that.</p>
<p>So, the phone theoretically performs a role of general paramount importance.  And not only is the phone your potential life-line, it&#8217;s what keeps you connected to the world around you.  For such a hefty role, the greatest phone for you should be one that complements your lifestyle (think of it is a companion). That being said, it&#8217;s obvious that a lot of thought needs to go into your choice of weaponry since it&#8217;ll more often than not come with an ugly two-year string attached.</p>
<p>BUT phones today have advanced to the point that buying one is strikingly similar to buying a computer.  As such, the same type of thought and work needs to go into the process to assure that you get the best use of the hardware with no compromise.  That being said, all of the considerations in this article are software related since you and I are at the mercy of the market in terms of hardware (one can only scream so loud).</p>
<p><strong>First things first.  The Operating Systems</strong></p>
<p>Each phone and OS have their selling feature, but what most don&#8217;t realize is that their are ways to get the best features of each OS with one device.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a few choices of operating systems from the different hardware manufacturers.  The most established OS&#8217;s are the iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile, Palm&#8217;s WebOS, RIM Blackberrry, and Nokia Symbian.   Statewide, the Symbian and WinMo OS&#8217;s seem to have done the best at failing (though Nokia is the best selling global manufacturer).    So the first obvious choice you have to make is the OS.  The debate of which is greatest is not the subject of the matter here.  It&#8217;s just important to know that each OS caters to a niche and that it&#8217;s important for you to choose the one that caters to your specific needs.   So what do you do after you decide which phone to get? Well, the next logical step would be to squeeze out every luxury you can from your investment.</p>
<p><strong>The iPhone</strong> &#8211; My Choice. My original reasoning for choosing this phone was to declutter my life (really, all I wanted was a phone that could simultaneously carry all of my music).   Sure the phone has evolved to complement my programming lifestyle within its three year existence, and certain implementation designs don&#8217;t command too much of my favor, but the overall construct is still near impossible to beat.  But, it wasn&#8217;t easy giving it the title of <em>the</em> phone I love&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;re the things I had to do:</p>
<p><strong>1) Jailbreak the thing.</strong> By doing so, you&#8217;re regaining control of the hardware:  <a href="http://www.appleiphonereview.com/iphone-tutorials/iphone-jailbreak/" target="_blank">instructions.</a></p>
<p><strong>2) Break free of AT&amp;T. </strong>I paid the full unsubsidized price so I unlocked mine and removed the data plan. Sure, not having the data plan sucks at times but it&#8217;s 30 bucks a month saved.  (If you do have the data plan, you can tether it to your laptop, which I imagine is nice).</p>
<p><strong>3) As the poetic lyrisist Juvenile would say, back that thang up. </strong> Download AptBackup and use iTunes to sync so you don&#8217;t have to repeat this process every firmware upgrade.  Keep doing this periodically.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4) Customize it with Winterboard</strong> (Everything from this point on is found in Cydia)<a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/t-mobile-mytouch-3g-ofc.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-213" title="t-mobile-mytouch-3g-ofc" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/t-mobile-mytouch-3g-ofc.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="258" /></a> Google &amp; T-Mobile started a campaign about how the MyTouch 3G was an extension of you&#8230; from the choice of icon sets to the background.  They claimed the phone was revolutionary, but interestingly I had been doing this for some time (read years) with my iPhone.  I remember that was the first thing I did.  With Winterboard you&#8217;re presented with a bewildering amount of customization options so play around and really make it yours.  Here&#8217;s  how Winterboard &amp; my phone look like:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0169.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-222" style="display: inline;" title="IMG_0169" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0169-200x300.png" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/p_480_320_B618A84A-8770-451C-A567-DBAC96832A98.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-215 alignnone" style="display: inline;" title="p_480_320_B618A84A-8770-451C-A567-DBAC96832A98.jpeg" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/p_480_320_B618A84A-8770-451C-A567-DBAC96832A98.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /> </a><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0166.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-221" style="display: inline;" title="layout" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0166-200x300.png" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">So with that, we&#8217;ve pretty much conquered the selling point of the MyTouch 3G (but not the whole Android experience)&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5) Configure VoIP</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blackberry.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-226 aligncenter" title="blackberry" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blackberry-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A while back, T-Mobile started this <a href="http://support.t-mobile.com/doc/tm23449.xml" target="_blank">UMA </a>feature on their blackberry lineups.  It wasn&#8217;t made into a big fuss, but the idea was spectacular.  The way it worked was if you placed a call over wifi from your house, it would be free.  That in itself was pretty awe inspiring because in your house really meant anywhere in the world with wifi.  But the real selling feature was that it would seamlessly transition into a wireless network if you stepped out of range, and the call would still be free.  That feature to me was mind boggling, and almost landed T-Mobile my business.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, where there is a will, there is way&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There&#8217;s an app called VoIPover3G (Cydia) and it works with Skype so that you can put your data plan to good use.  I don&#8217;t have the data plan, but I know it works.  What I do use is my unlimited US calling plan with Skype to save my minutes when I&#8217;m in wireless range and the VoIP works anywhere in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/skype-iphone-3.0.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-227 aligncenter" title="skype-iphone-3.0" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/skype-iphone-3.0-277x300.png" alt="" width="277" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>6) Continuing with the Blackberry Feature set&#8230;</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Continuing our onslaught of blackberry features (I&#8217;ve never owned a blackberry, so I can&#8217;t really go way in depth):</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the biggest complaints was the lack of a physical keyboard.  There&#8217;s a paid app called Vibrus3G and it too has a beweldering amount of customizations but it gives your phone the tactile feedback a physical keyboard affords that many have come to love . Feels just like the real thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps the greatest weak point blackberry lovers have with the iPhone has been the single Microsoft Exchange capacity.  There&#8217;s a rather involved workaround to that which allows those execs and business types access to all their email accounts.  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5440633/use-multiple-exchange-accounts-on-your-jailbroken-iphone" target="_blank">Here</a>.  I personally don&#8217;t use it, but it&#8217;s there for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As for that scrolling ball&#8230; you&#8217;ll have to just compromise.  Can&#8217;t have everything.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>7) Multiple Processes &amp; Task Management:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/palm-e1264029821695.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-281" style="display: inline;" title="palm" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/palm-e1264030672473-300x232.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="232" /></a><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0163.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-220" style="display: inline;" title="IMG_0163" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0163-200x300.png" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For some reason, the apple designers didn&#8217;t think its users should run multiple applications simultaneously.  That&#8217;s dumb and just shows how apple tries to oversimplify too much.  WebOS stunned the world with it&#8217;s task management system, but the diligent iPhone community fought back.  Backgrounder plus ProSwitcher are both free and are stunning in combination</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>8 ) Empower yourself.</strong></p>
<p><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/photo.jpg"></a></p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">One of the greatest add-ons I&#8217;ve found has been the SBS settings.  With it, all of the major controls are a swipe away.  Gone are the days of going into the Settings.app to turn something on or off.  This is just bliss.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></span></div>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-231 aligncenter" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="photo" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/photo-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>9) Get Googlie-Eyed (?)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ok, so this one I&#8217;m not so sure about&#8230; but just to be thorough. There are avenues to get some of Android&#8217;s great features on the iPhone.  They have official and unofficial apps that affords the indexing of your files, speech search, etc, but being the intelligent corporation that they are, they chose to keep many of the features Android only (such as their new turn by turn navigation).  Anywhoo, for those that still rely on the Maps.app for directions, there&#8217;s an offlinemaps plugin in Cydia.  (Allows me to use navigation without the data plan).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>10) Show a little love:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The shadowy brain figure behind Cydia developed an app that displays contact pictures in your phone&#8217;s phone book.  It&#8217;s only a dollar, and honestly you&#8217;re supporting his work that made most of this possible (You can&#8217;t throw money to the Dev-Team, the guys behind jailbreaking though&#8230;) rather than prettying your phone.  So just go ahead and buy it.  It&#8217;s called Cyntact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>11) Hope for improvements:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, with all good comes some bad.  I&#8217;m very close to completely being head over heels for my phone.  It&#8217;s definately a love relationship, but it could be bettered.  Some things that I see missing and are still needed to polish the experience are:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="340" height="285" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zsv6YfSWugc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;border=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="340" height="285" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zsv6YfSWugc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;border=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Better accessibility solutions are needed, period.  Have you seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/EyesFreeAndroid" target="_blank">TVRaman</a>&#8217;s solution Apple?  The accessibility solutions on the iPhone leave a lot to be desired (the potential for a new interface could really send this thing soaring in both the disabled and enabled community).  Oh, and a simple screen reading solution for say the Kindle application would also be steller (whether from Apple or Amazon).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Home Screen / Social Network Intergration</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/cliq.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-232 aligncenter" style="display: inline;" title="cliq" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/cliq-300x277.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="277" /></a><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/lockscreen.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-233 aligncenter" style="display: inline;" title="lockscreen" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/lockscreen-204x300.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-A much better use for the lock screen is needed.  Intelliscreen is ok, it costs money and isn&#8217;t really that effective.   The stupid bubble that pops up is useless and is a poor use of the space.  Some intelligent interactive version of the above would put the iPhone on a new competitive level.  These <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/2009/09/22/iphone-needs-a-new-home/" target="_blank">guys </a>are almost on the money:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hardware Changes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-Forward facing screen for video chat&#8230; (some argue against this, citing the stupidity that would ensue [read: idiots using this while walking], but at least humor us with the option&#8230; Please).  Oh and replace the old hardware with this free.   Thanks!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/videoChat.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-234 aligncenter" title="videoChat" src="http://androwis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/videoChat-264x300.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And for the way nerdy:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Bluetooth stack remembrance: you know how wifi remembers networks, something like that for bluetooth (autosearch &amp; autoconnect would be spectacular).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- A way to mount an external network drive so you could stream movies using VLC with the terminal app.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And for the OCD:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- I don&#8217;t know why Apple didn&#8217;t make the bezel around the screen white for the white iPhone.  Also (though it would be battery draining) you should at least have given those poor users the choice as having white for the default background.  The half black/half white looks hideous.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other than that&#8230; I heart my iPhone.  I&#8217;d love to link similar tutorials for other phones too:</p>
