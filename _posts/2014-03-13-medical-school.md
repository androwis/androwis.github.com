tweet: how my journey in computer science led me to medical school.

I would not have guessed my journey into computer science would lead me to 
medical school.

Computer science fulfills my passion to create. As a medium, my inner engineer 
is given a platform to explore, understand and develop systems. I love using
technology to build systems that enable others to do things that were once
previously impossible for them. 

However, learning the differences between healing and enabling has transformed
computer science into my personal stepping stone to medicine. I entered the 
field of accessibility as an undergraduate. From there, it took me 8 years
of exploring the role interfaces play in the lives of handicapped individuals, 
understanding how computers work, and building stuff to *finally* learn why 
I want to marry technology and medicine. 

Ultimately, I felt there was too great of a disconnect when I serve people 
tangentially through technology. At the end of the day, the relationships
I form with users are the most valuable aspect of my work, and that is an 
aspect I feel computer science fails to emphasize, and I believe unjustly so. 

The process of learning about people's dreams and insecurities collectively
shape the role I hope to play through medicine. That role became clear to me
in bits and pieces through shadowing physicians. Observing their relationships 
with patients allowed me to see how healing encompasses many things; among  those are
direct care, devotion, and service to patients. Despite the different procedures
I witnessed, each specialty demonstrated an almost identical form of these
elements. Valuing education and exemplifying strong desires to teach, each
physician stopped multiple times a day to make sure the patients and I were
learning. The sprint to reassure the family of a premature baby of a successful
surgery felt one in the same as the compassion I felt watching the creation of 
a group clinic for underserved populations in rural NC. 

As a programmer serving the disabled, I can cater to physical limitations - but
I cannot heal. I believe computer science is a powerful tool, but medicine is
the foundation I must have in order to fulfill my desire to directly serve and
care for others. I do not want to just alleviate frustrations, but rather help
others rehabilitate their lives. After pursuing a career of service based on my
abilities as a programmer, I have learned firsthand that computer science alone
is not enough to serve others the way I want. With medicine I hope to fill the 
void created by these limitations to provide more comprehensive and direct care 
by bridging the strengths of both disciplines.

That is what it took for me to realize I needed to make the shift into medicine.
I found myself asking whether or not I'm happy with how I spent my time in graduate 
school. I knew the answer was no, but I had no idea where that dissatisfaction
came from, and I believe it was because I was afraid of what I'd find out. 
eaving one career path for another is horrifying at first. But driven by the 
right reasons, those fears just don't exist. I encourage everyone to ask
those really hard questions and identify their drives. The journey is incredibly
hard but incredibly rewarding. You won't have any regrets. 

I know I'm so excited to have found my role in cancer genomics, and am looking
forward to pursuing my life in medicine.
