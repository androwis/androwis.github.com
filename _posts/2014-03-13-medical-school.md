tweet: how my journey in computer science led me to medical school.

I would not have guessed my journey into computer science would lead me to 
medical school.

Computer science fulfills my passion to create. As a medium, my inner engineer 
is given a platform to explore, understand and develop systems. I have used
technology to build systems that enable others to do things previously
impossible to them. However, discovering the differences between healing and
enabling has transformed computer science into my personal stepping stone to
medicine.

I entered the field of accessibility as an undergraduate. From there, it took 
me 8 years of exploring the role interfaces play in the lives of handicapped 
individuals, understanding how computers work, and building stuff to learn
why I want to marry technology and medicine. 

I feel there is a disconnect when I serve people tangentially through technology.
At the end of the day, the relationships I form with users are the most valuable 
aspect of my work. Learning about people's dreams and insecurities have
collectively shaped the role I hope to play through medicine.

The role became clear to me as I shadowed physicians and observed their
relationships with patients. Healing encompasses many things; among  those are
direct care, devotion, and service to patients. Despite the different procedures
I witnessed, each specialty demonstrated an almost identical form of these
elements. Valuing education and exemplifying strong desires to teach, each
physician stopped multiple times a day to make sure the patients and I were
learning. The sprint to reassure the family of a premature baby of a successful
surgery felt one in the same as the compassion I felt watching the creation of 
a group clinic for underserved populations in rural NC. 

As a programmer serving the disabled, I can cater to physical limitations - but
I cannot heal. I believe computer science is a powerful tool, but medicine is
the foundation I must have in order to fulfill my desire to directly serve and
care for others. I do not want to just alleviate frustrations, but rather help
others rehabilitate their lives. After pursuing a career of service based on my
abilities as a programmer, I have learned firsthand that computer science has
serious limitations.

With medicine I hope to fill the void created by these limitations to provide
more comprehensive and direct care by bridging the abilities of both disciplines.

That is what it took for me to realize I needed to make the shift into medicine.
I often found myself asking if I'm happy with how I spent my time in graduate 
school. I knew the answer was no, but I had no idea where that dissatisfaction
came from because I was afraid of what I was going to find out. 

Leaving one career path for another is horrifying at first. But driven by the 
right reasons, those fears just don't exist. I encourage everyone to ask
those really hard questions and identify their drives. The journey is hard but
incredibly rewarding. You won't have any regrets. 

I know I'm so excited to have found my role in cancer genomics, and am looking
forward to pursuing my career in medicine.
