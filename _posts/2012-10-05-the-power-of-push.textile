title: The Power of Push
tweet: Ira Glass on why making things awesome is so hard
---
I love this quote from [This American Life's] Ira Glass about [pushing] something from mediocrity into the realm of something incredible: 
<blockquote>"For me, pushing myself is way more about &quot;It's hard to make something that's interesting.&quot;<br/><br/>
 It's really, really hard, and I'm sure we don't succeed with every story on every show. Basically, anything that anyone makes. It's like a law of nature, a law of aerodynamics, that anything that's written or anything that's created wants to be mediocre. <br/><br/>
 The natural state of all writing is mediocrity. It's all tending toward mediocrity in the same way that all atoms are sort of dissipating out toward the expanse of the universe. Everything wants to be mediocre, so what it takes to make anything more than mediocre is such a <i>fucking</i> act of will. Anyone who makes something for a living, or even not for a living, if they're really excited about it.  You just have to exert so much will into something for it to be good. <br/><br/>
  That feels exactly the same now as it did the first week of the show. That hasn't changed at all. That's the premise of what it takes to make something."</blockquote>
