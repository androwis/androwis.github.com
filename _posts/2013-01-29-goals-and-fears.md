##Goals

I often find myself asking if I'm happy with how I spend my time. I knew the answer was no, but I had no idea where that dissatisfaction came from.


So, I took a weekend to write down my goals. I wanted to understand what I was distracting myself from and which fears were preventing me from accopmlishing my goals:


###Short term goals:
    - Be early. For everything.
    - Do the things I want to do.
    - Explore my world.
    - Be proud of myself, and what I feel.
    - Prefer relationships to work.
    - Disconnect intentionally, feel safe and secure in that decision.


###Long term goals:
    - Help those I care about.


###Fears:
    - I'm not adding value to whatever I'm working on.
    - My difficulties are really inabilities.
    - Trusting others.
    - Academia.

##What I learned.

Fears are much easier to identify than goals. That's a hard pill to swallow since I know fears take away from the motivation goals provide. That also may be a result of being in school, where you need to explore the open set of problems to identify what you want to contribute to.


This last year, I lost most of my trust for some of the closest people around me. Also, I've become jaded with academia's self-centered nature (all the pressure's to publish to establish your "expertise", citations as a metric of success, affirming command of a topic by tacking ", right?" to the end of a sentence).


I'm glad I put some thought on this.  I hate not having all the answers or an un-relenting drive / passion for my work ( I'm not sure whether that's the perfectionist in me or society talking). But then, perhaps the most exciting part of all this is the volatility.
