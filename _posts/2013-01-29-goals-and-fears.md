I often find myself asking if I'm happy with how I spend my time. I knew the answer was no, but I had no idea where that dissatisfaction came from.


So, I took a weekend to write down my goals. I wanted to understand what I was distracting myself from and which fears were preventing me from accomplishing my goals:


###Short term goals:
    - Disconnect intentionally, feel safe and secure in that decision.
    - Be proud of myself, and what I feel.
    - Prefer relationships to work.
    - Do the things I want to do.
    - Be early. For everything.
    - Explore my world.

###Long term goals:
    - Help those I care about.
    - Love deeply.

###Fears:
    - I'm not adding value to whatever I'm working on.
    - My difficulties are really inabilities.
    - Trusting others.
    - Academia.

##What I learned.

Fears are much easier to identify than goals. That's a hard pill to swallow since I know fears take away from the motivation goals provide.

I can't measure any of my current goals.  That's scary to me, because my mathematical mind believes anything that can't be measured doesn't exist.

This last year, I lost most of my trust for some of the closest people around me. Also, I've become jaded with academia's self-centered nature (all the pressure's to publish to establish your "expertise", citations as a metric of success, affirming command of a topic by tacking ", right?" to the end of a sentence). That being said, some of the people I hold in the highest of esteem are in academia... I'm just not sure it's the thing for me.

I'm glad I put some thought on this.  I hate not having all the answers or an un-relenting drive / passion for my work at all times ( I'm not sure whether that's the perfectionist in me or society talking). It's hard not to get discouraged when comparing yourself to titans all the time. But then, perhaps the most exciting part of all this is the volatility.
