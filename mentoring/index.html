                  <p><em>Part of a <a href="http://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring">distributed mentoring movement</a>.</em></p>
<p>Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others.</p>
<p>I’ve had so many great experiences in my life, and I’d love to share them if you’re considering pursuing a similar path.</p>
<ul>
<li>2003-2006, I explored my love for art and design through the help of Wayland Shamburger of <a href="http://shamburgerdesignstudio.com"> Shamburger Design Studio</a></li><br/>
<li>2005-2009 were some of the best years of my life, as I explored the wild world of stocks with <a href="http://www.cpc.unc.edu/people/fellows/bio?person=turchi">Dr. Boone Turchi</a> and numerical analysis with <a href="http://mitran.web.unc.edu/">Dr. Sorin Mitran</a> [this man is a genius] while falling in love with computer languages thanks to <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/~jsterrel">Dr. Jeff Terrell</a></li><br/>
<li>2008 marked my introduction into assistive technology as <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/~gb">Dr. Gary Bishop</a> and I explored the use of an online auditory interface as a new assistive technology for the blind</li><br/>
<li>I started <a href="http://scenedipity.com/">Scenedipity</a> in 2011 as an open data platform for restaurant and food truck information. This has been my introduction to and playground for the NoSQL movement with the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/jshoffstall">Justin Shoffstall</a> who currently works for Basho</li><br/>
<li> I'm currently Director of Engineering at <a href="http://simply-home.com">Simply Home</a> where I develop assistive technologies and business solutions for people with disabilities.  I'm also a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rochester under the advising of <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~jbigham/"> Dr. Jeff Bigham</a> as I continue my study of dynamic user interfaces and artificial intelligence</li>

</ul><p>If you’d like to work together, you can write me a letter responding to the questions below; I’ll write back to all letters I receive in this way within two weeks no matter what. In response to the most exceptional letters, I’ll propose further correspondence—and in certain cases, an ongoing mentoring relationship.</p>
<p>1. Tell me about yourself. How did you become who you are, and who do you want to become?</p>
<p>2. What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?</p>
<p>3. What’s the best thing you’ve read, watched, or listened to lately?</p>
<p>Add links to any profiles or projects you’re proud of, and send it all to:<br/><em><a href="mailto:androwis@androw.is">androwis@androw.is</a></em></p>
<p>I look forward to learning together!</p>
